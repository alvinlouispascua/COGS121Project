# Milestone 4

## UI webpages

## How the UI has improved
Our UI has improved significantly on the page where users can browse food banks, healthcare, and shelters. The google maps was enlarged so that seeing where a location is was more intuitive and straightforward. Also, instead of having three separate pages, there is one page that has tabs that switch between healthcare, food banks, and shelters, so that a user does not have to return to home to browse different resources. An info icon button was added to each resource so that users can click on that to access phone number, website, and exact geographical location. The list of resources was moved all the way to the left so that the user interface is intuitively divided into two sections: the list and the map. Finally, the back button was moved to the bottom rather than the top to make it less of a priority. 

## Two non-trivial actions description
The two non-trivial actions that we implemented are: 1) Getting additional information about a shelter, food bank, or health clinic (phone number, website, exact geographical location) and 2) Being able to see the resource on Google Maps. We used to different APIs to implement these different user actions: Google Places API for the first one, and Google Maps API for the second, and this is how they were non-trivial to implement because it took a while to understand how to use the APIs and to implement them to make the actions possible. The actions differ from one another in a significant way because one is just getting more text information through an API call, while the other is actually seeing the location on Google Maps.
