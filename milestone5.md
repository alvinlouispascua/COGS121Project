## How our UI has improved

Our user interface has improved in several ways. Firstly, the colors on the resources pages have been completely changed to match the color scheme of the home page. Second, the typography among each different resource (food banks, shelters, and healthcare) was changed to make it consistent across resources. Also, we increased the font weight on subtitles such as hours and address to differentiate them visually from the content. Also, we changed the UI's implementation and the size of each component so that it works on nearly every display size. Previously, the info icon buttons would collapse into the list item but these bugs were fixed. Also, the size of the Google Maps component now changes as the browser size changes so it never becomes too large. Finally, the marker for the Google Maps was changed from a circle to a more traditional pointer.
